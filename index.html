    <h2>Biography:</h2>
    <p>As a wee lad Jeff rose to fame by slaying Moby Dick. Ahab, his captain at the time, reportedly said that he owed Jeff his life and he would be forever greatful. Sadly his whaling career was cut tragically short when he lodged a fish hook in his thumb and lost all stomach for the commercial whaling business. In the time since, he's been a professional cookie eater, a shiftless layabout and a man of leisure. These days he's occupying his time with sloth and gluttony, two of his favorite cardinal sins.</p>
